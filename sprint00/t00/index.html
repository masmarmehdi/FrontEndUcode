        <h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>
        <p>
            A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t.
        So in order to be a superhero, <strong>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</strong>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds.
        Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br>
        For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story.
        But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story.
        If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.

        <p>
            Captain America is the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young artist enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental "super-soldier serum" after joining the military to aid the United States government's efforts in World War II.
