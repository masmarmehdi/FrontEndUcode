        <h2><u>Who is Kevin De Bruyne ?</u></h2>
        <span>Kevin De Bruyne is a Belgian footballer who plays for the English Premier League team ‘Manchester City’ as
            well
            as the Belgian national team. Named the ‘fourth best footballer’ in the world by ‘The Guardian’ in 2017, he
            is
            frequently described by the media as a ‘complete footballer’ as well as the ‘Best European Footballer.’ Born
            and
            brought up in Ghent, Belgium, he started his amateur football career from his hometown and played in the
            team
            ‘Genk,’ leading his team to a win at the 2010-11 ‘Belgian Pro League.’ His performance didn’t go unnoticed
            by
            the Premier League teams, and he was signed on by ‘Chelsea’ in 2012. He was later signed on by the German
            club
            ‘Wolfsburg’ and earned the honour, ‘2015’s Footballer of the Year’ in Germany. The honour came to him
            following
            his successful 2014-15 season with Wolfsburg, comprising of 16 goals and 27 assists. In August 2015,
            Manchester
            City announced about his inclusion in the team in a six years contract. As a part of the Belgian team, Kevin
            played in the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the UEFA Euro 2016.</span>
            <h2><u>His Career</u></h2>
        <p>In 2008, his hard-work finally paid off and he was selected for the first team squad in Genk and made his
            debut in May 2009. However, he was only able to establish himself in the team by the next year. The 2010-11
            season turned out to be lucky one for Genk as they were crowned with the Belgian Championship. In all the 32
            games that he played in the league, Kevin scored five goals and 16 assists.<br><br>
            In October 2011, Kevin scored his first hat-trick for Genk in a match winning performance against Club
            Brugge. He finished the league with 8 goals that he scored in 28 matches. By February 2012, English club
            Chelsea had decided to bring Kevin in their team and Kevin made his debut for them in July 2012.<br><br>
            In August 2012, Chelsea made the official announcement regarding the temporary transfer of Kevin to the
            German team Werder Bremen ahead of the Bundesliga. His competitive performance in Bundesliga justified his
            loaning perfectly and in July 2013, Kevin made a comeback to the official Chelsea line-up.<br><br>
            In a friendly game against Malaysia just ahead of the 2013-14 season, Kevin injured his knee while scoring a
            goal. He was however fit before he made his competitive debut in the premier league against Hull City. In
            the game that Chelsea won, Kevin assisted in scoring of the first goal for his team.<br>
            Following his sub-par performance for Chelsea, the team decided to let him go in January 2014 to Wolfsburg.
            In the 2014-15 Europa League, he performed excellently and caught all the right attentions. In the third
            group stage match, he scored two goals against Krasnodar and in the next game against Bayern Munich, he
            further ensured his team’s victory by scoring another goal.<br><br>
            Kevin ended the league season with 10 goals and 21 assists and his team ended up as the first runner up by
            the end of the league. This had them qualifying pretty easily for the 2014-15 UEFA Champions League. Ending
            his debut season for Wolfsburg with 16 goals in total, he was named the Footballer of the Year in Germany.
            His 21 assists in the league was a new record.<br>
            It was reported in early 2015 that English club Manchester City was closely following Kevin and approached
            him twice before he finally accepted their offer in August 2015. Towards the end of August, official
            announcement was made by Manchester City that they had acquired Kevin for a six years contract. He was
            purchased for an amount of 55 million pounds, making him the second costliest purchase by any English club.
            He scored in almost all his first few games for MC and in October 2015, it was speculated that he was being
            considered for a Ballon D’or award. He played a major role in getting his team to the finals of the Football
            League Club. But an unfortunate injury in the semi-finals had him taking break from the field for next two
            months.<br><br>
            In April 2016, he made a comeback right ahead of the UEFA Champions League and he further scored goals to
            lead his team to the semi-finals. This was the first time that Manchester City had reached this far in
            Champions League. But his team’s aspirations of winning the league remained unfulfilled.
            He was named ‘man of the match’ twice in September 2016 and had a fairly good season.<br>
            In January 2018,Manchester City announced that they will be keeping him until 2023 as a new contract had been signed.
            As for his international career, it was rumoured that Kevin will be playing in the English national team
            given the fact that his mother was an English woman. But he chose Belgium and made his international debut
            for Belgium in a friendly match against Finland in 2010. Before his final arrival into the senior team, he
            had been a part of many under age teams for his country.<br>
            In May 2014, he was announced as one of the very first players to be chosen for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and
            in his team’s very first match against Algeria, he was named ‘man of the match’. He was also named in the
            national squad for UEFA Euro 2016. His national team performed poorly and was eliminated out in the early
            stages itself.</p>
